### Required Submission Files
* PDF Report containing write-ups describing design of neural networks and answers to questions
* README.txt which gives instructions to run the code and explanations of sample output obtained from your code
* Relevant source code (e.g. Part1 and Part2 IPYNB files)

### Dataset for Part 1 obtained from this link: 
https://github.com/TheAnig/NER-LSTM-CNN-Pytorch/tree/master/data

> Disclaimer: Personally only worked on Part 1

### Part 1 Remarks:
Part 1 will take really long to train (~8hrs for 10 epochs, excluding the time needed to reload the model as Google Colab disconnected) so do be prepared to allocate it enough time for training.

![Part 1 Remarks](./part1_remarks.png)

Follow the instructions in the image above carefully, especially if you need to reload the model after a Google Colab disconnection.

We only ran the model for 10 epochs due to time constraints and this [reference](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9819/number-of-epochs-in-gensim-word2vec-implementation), so do feel free to try to run it for more epochs to get better results for the model.
